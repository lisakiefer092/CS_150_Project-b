## Energy Depletion in Europe

#### According to the US Environmental Protection Agency, Energy and Heat production accounts for about 34% of the total global Greenhouse gas emissions (2019). In the light of climate change, it is important to evaluate the energy consumption status among regions to ensure sufficient access but also to enhance the reliance on renewable energy sources.

### Context



### Data 
For this project, I selected a CVS file from the World Bank Data that has stored for each country in the world the percentage it's Gross National Income, which basically represents how much of a nations wealth is spend on depleating their energy resources. I chose this data frame because I thought it would provide a different perspective on how we approach our energy instead of just looking at energy consumption per capita or renewable energy share, plus the value of energy depleation is interesting from both an environmental and economic perspective - if the energy depleation ratio is high, then it has negative impact on the environment because the energy resource is quicker depleated than it can regenerate, and it also impacts the economy as the resource will become more expensive it is more scarce.
